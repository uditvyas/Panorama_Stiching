Steps to run the code:

1. The python files are main.py, helper.py and inbuilt_functions.py
2. In order to run the code, first create a new virtualenv, and install the dependencies (optional, may avoid if they are preinstalled). 
3. Next, Check the main.py, and do the following
    - Uncomment the set which you want to generate the result for from all the inputs taken
    - Specially read the comments added for SET 3 and SET 6, as they are exceptional cases. Comment the code correctly to avoid any errors. The explanation for this is provided in the report.
    - Do not change the input lines, as it may drastically change the results.
    - The code runs over some assumptions, that have been mentioned in the report
4. Run the python code main.py
5. Repeat the process as in step 3, for inbuilt_functions.py, to generate the results using inbuit functions for Homography matrix.

The results will be stored in the directories results, and inbuilt_results for main.py and inbuilt_functions.py respectively. 

All the helper functions for both the files have been included in the helper.py file.
